# Portfolio-Optimization
Welcome to my **Portfolio optimisation** project, where we dive into the world of smart investing by balancing risk and reward through data-driven strategies! üéØ
***
## Objective
In this project, I‚Äôve employed advanced techniques like Monte Carlo Simulation and Genetic Algorithm to craft optimal portfolios that maximize **returns** while minimizing **risk**. By leveraging historical data, I've identified the perfect mix of assets to deliver the highest Sharpe Ratio and lowest volatility.

Whether you're a seasoned investor or just curious about the science behind portfolio management, this project reveals how data and algorithms come together to navigate the complexities of the financial markets. Join me as we explore the fascinating intersection of finance and technology, bringing insights that can transform investment strategies!

## Key concepts
Now, let‚Äôs delve into a few of the key concepts underpinning investment strategy and portfolio management. Understanding these fundamentals can provide a clearer view of the techniques used in this project and their practical significance in the investment world:

*  **Risk and Return**: In the realm of investing, risk is synonymous with uncertainty, it's the possibility of experiencing losses. Return, on the other hand, represents the gains made on an investment. Finding the right balance between these two is the cornerstone of successful portfolio management, as higher returns often come with increased risk.

* **Diversification**: Often referred to as the only ‚Äúfree lunch‚Äù in finance, diversification is about spreading investments across different assets to mitigate risk. By holding a mix of assets, we can potentially smooth out returns, making the portfolio less vulnerable to the poor performance of any single asset.

In portfolio optimization, portfolio weights refer to the proportion of the total investment allocated to each asset within a portfolio. These weights play a crucial role in shaping the portfolio‚Äôs risk-return profile, as different allocations can significantly impact both the potential returns and the overall risk.

To decide on the ideal portfolio weights, investors rely on specific metrics that evaluate the trade-offs between risk and reward. These metrics provide insights into how each asset contributes to the portfolio's performance, enabling informed decisions on asset allocation. Two critical metrics often used in this process are the Sharpe Ratio and Volatility:

* **Sharpe Ratio**: This metric is key to assessing the quality of returns relative to the risks taken. A high Sharpe Ratio signifies a favourable risk-adjusted return, helping investors gauge how well they are compensated for the risk involved.

* **Volatility**: Often used as a proxy for risk, volatility measures the extent of price fluctuations over time. Investors seek to manage volatility within their portfolios to avoid significant swings in value, especially during turbulent market periods.

other important parameters used in this project implementation include:
**portfolio variance**, **covariance**, and **log returns** to evaluate and optimize asset allocations. These measures provide a quantitative foundation for assessing risk and return, guiding the optimization process to build a well-balanced portfolio.

* **log return**: Logarithmic returns, or log returns, measure the continuous growth rate of an asset. They are calculated as the natural logarithm of the current price ratio to the previous price.
* **portfolio variance**: Portfolio variance quantifies overall portfolio risk by measuring the spread of potential returns. It is calculated as the weighted sum of the variances and covariances of the assets within the portfolio.
* **covariance**: Covariance measures the degree to which two assets move relative to each other. A positive covariance indicates that the assets tend to move in the same direction, while a negative covariance means they move in opposite directions.
* **expected return**: The expected return of a portfolio is the weighted average of the expected returns of the individual assets within the portfolio.

## Models

*  **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Monte Carlo simulation is a computational technique used to model and analyze the probability of different outcomes in processes that involve random variables. It relies on running numerous simulations to generate various possible results, which helps understand potential risks and uncertainties.


* **Genetic Algorithm (DEAP)**: The Genetic Algorithm (GA) in DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) is a powerful tool for solving optimization problems by mimicking the process of natural selection. DEAP provides an easy-to-use framework for implementing GA, where a population of potential solutions evolves over generations. By using operators like selection, crossover, and mutation, the algorithm iteratively improves upon solutions to find an optimal or near-optimal result.
